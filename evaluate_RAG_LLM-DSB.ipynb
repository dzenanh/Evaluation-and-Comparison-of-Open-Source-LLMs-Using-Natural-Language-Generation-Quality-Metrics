      "Q: How do LLMs' attention limits affect their role in dynamic security tasks, despite tools like PentestGPT?\n",
      "A: LLMs' attention and situational awareness limitations significantly hinder their effectiveness in dynamic security tasks, such as penetration testing. They struggle to maintain a coherent understanding of the broader testing scenario, which leads to losing sight of earlier findings and applying reasoning consistently. LLMs tend to overemphasize recent tasks and neglect other potential attack surfaces, especially if they are not directly related to the current conversation. This real-time decision-making and adaptability deficiency is crucial in offensive security, where context and rapid analysis are vital. Tools like PentestGPT can assist in specific sub-tasks, but they still lack the ability to self-assess or improve without external guidance, and their reliance on instruction means they may not actively explore all possible avenues without human intervention.\n",
      "GT: LLMs typically lack situational awareness, which is critical in dynamic and context-dependent settings. They do not possess an understanding of the world in the same way humans do, nor can they interpret context beyond the scope of their training data. This limitation is particularly evident in scenarios requiring real-time decision-making or adaptation to new and unforeseen circumstances, which can impede their effectiveness in roles that require a high level of contextual adaptability. This limitation is a very steep hurdle for using LLMs to conduct offensive security due to the real time nature of the problem set that makes up penetration testing.\n",

The focus is on cloud security, penetration testing, artificial intelligence, and security tools for detecting and analyzing vulnerabilities. To find information on how auto-grade MCUs and remote access might speed up ECU network tests, you would need to look at literature outside the given context, as it does not address automotive network testing technology.\n",
      "GT: Auto-grade MCUs and remote access speed up ECU network tests by providing a programmable ECU on the network to launch attacks or implement defenses. This setup allows for rapid configuration and experimentation with numerous ECU networks, supporting the development of research projects. The automotive-grade MCU mimics having programming access to an ECU, enabling advanced attacks and precise microcontroller-level timing that cannot be achieved by a PC-USB interface.\n",

      "Q: How does the critical load shedding threshold affect DASM and induction motor stability during fault recovery?\n",
      "A: The critical load shedding threshold plays a crucial role in determining the dynamic action-joint security margin (DASM) during fault recovery in the induction motor system. If the shed load is below this threshold, the motor slip may increase beyond a safe limit (s2), leading to motor stalling and a failed Unbalanced Voltage Load Shedding (UVLS) scenario. This results in an insecure point with a negative margin. Conversely, if the shed load is sufficient, the motor slip remains below s2, ensuring stability and a feasible UVLS, which corresponds to a secure point with a positive margin. The threshold, denoted as ∂ALS,P, is the minimum amount of load that must be shed to maintain stability at a specific operating point P. The DASM calculation takes into account both the distance from the operating point to the action decision boundary (∂ADSR) and the impact of load shedding on the security margin.\n",
      "GT: The critical load shedding threshold is the minimum amount of load that must be shed to ensure the system's stability. If the load shedding is sufficient, the motor slip will consistently remain below s2 throughout the recovery, ensuring stability. Conversely, if the load shedding amount is insufficient, the slip ratio s will continue to escalate, surpassing s2, leading to motor stalling and a failed UVLS scenario. This threshold directly impacts the dynamic action-jointed security margin (DASM) by influencing the system's stability during fault recovery.\n",

      "A: The exploratory study using GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard on the pen testing benchmark, which includes OWASP's top 10 vulnerabilities and 18 CWE items, evaluates the LLMs' performance on complex tasks and coherence. The approach involves crafting iterative prompts, guiding the LLMs through penetration testing steps, executing their suggestions, and providing feedback to refine their next steps. This method allows for a systematic and quantitative assessment of the LLMs' capability in automated penetration testing, revealing their strengths and limitations in handling real-world tasks and problem-solving within the cybersecurity domain. However, the specific results and comparative analysis of the LLMs' performance are not provided in the given context.\n",
      "GT: The chosen LLMs demonstrate proficiency in managing specific sub-tasks within the testing process, such as utilizing testing tools, interpreting their outputs, and suggesting subsequent actions. However, they struggle with maintaining a coherent grasp of the overarching testing scenario, which is vital for attaining the testing goal. As the dialogue advances, they may lose sight of earlier discoveries and struggle to apply their reasoning consistently toward the final objective. Additionally, LLMs overemphasize recent tasks in the conversation history, regardless of their vulnerability status, leading them to neglect other potential attack surfaces exposed in prior tests and fail to complete the penetration testing task.\n",

      "Q: How does PTHelper's modular design and black-box support differ from past pentesting methods?\n",
      "A: PTHelper's modular design and black-box support differ from past pentesting methods in several ways. Firstly, it operates in a realistic black-box scenario, where the pentester does not have prior knowledge of the environment, unlike white-box scenarios in previous approaches. This allows for a more realistic and adaptable testing process, mimicking an actual attacker's approach. \n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, PTHelper automates the entire pentesting process, not just isolated phases, by orchestrating the interaction between its four specialized modules that cover different phases of the assessment. This contrasts with past studies that focused on automating specific parts without providing a comprehensive, end-to-end solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, PTHelper is designed to be flexible and adaptable, with modular components that can be modified or extended to accommodate various types of penetration testing, such as Web or Mobile application testing. This allows it to evolve alongside the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, PTHelper aims to support the pentester throughout the entire assessment, including the reporting phase, unlike some past approaches that only addressed specific parts or did not provide a usable tool for reporting. By providing a complete and practical solution, PTHelper enhances the efficiency of the pentesting process while maintaining the need for human oversight.\n",
      "GT: PTHelper's modular design and black-box support differ from past pentesting methods by providing supportive functionality throughout the entire penetration testing assessment, including reporting. Unlike previous methods that often focus on a single phase or require a white-box scenario where all variables are known in advance, PTHelper is designed to work in a black-box scenario, helping pentesters discover information as they go, similar to a real attacker.\n",

Instead, it describes an AI offensive agent that combines a Large Language Model (which could include GPT-like capabilities) with advanced retrieval and command execution capabilities. The agent conducts automated penetration testing by simulating offensive tactics, using tools like ping, nmap, dns, and nikto for reconnaissance, and exploiting vulnerabilities like the \"Eternal Blue\" exploit on Hack The Box.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding ethical issues, the context highlights that ReaperAI is designed to adhere to ethical guidelines by focusing on designated machines and avoiding unauthorized actions that could disrupt services or compromise data integrity. It incorporates explicit constraints into its prompts to ensure that its operations remain within predetermined boundaries. This structured approach helps maintain trust and accountability in the automated security assessments, ensuring that the testing is conducted ethically and justifiably within the research framework. However, the text does not explicitly address the potential for misuse or unintended consequences that could arise from the advanced capabilities of the AI, which is a common concern with the use of powerful AI in cybersecurity.\n",
      "GT: ReaperAI leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 to identify, exploit, and analyze security vulnerabilities autonomously. It operates within a structured environment using Python, enhanced by Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for contextual understanding and memory retention.

      "calling LLM, question:  8\n",
      "Q: How does the context size limiter save costs with LLMs?\n",
      "A: The context size limiter, by employing LLM models with extended token sizes like 8k and 32k, helps save costs by conserving token usage. It prevents the need for excessive tokens to store the entire conversation history, which can be particularly important in scenarios where a single testing tool output might require thousands of tokens. This approach allows for more efficient use of the model's capacity and prevents the model from focusing solely on recent content or local tasks, thereby mitigating the issue of context loss.\n",
      "GT: The context size limiter saves costs with LLMs by reducing the context size, which is directly related to the used token count. Since the token count is directly related to the occurring costs, reducing the context size would also reduce the cost of using LLMs.\n",

      "calling LLM, question:  9\n",
      "Q: How can Large Language Models (LLMs) be leveraged to develop a fully autonomous offensive security agent?\n",
      "A: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged to develop a fully autonomous offensive security agent by implementing periodic updates and fine-tuning sessions using the latest threat data, such as CVEs. This ensures that the agent remains current with new tactics and vulnerabilities. Prompt engineering techniques can be employed to guide the model's responses and simulate evolving attack scenarios, even though LLMs do not inherently learn from interactions. By maintaining a controlled update process rather than real-time learning, the offensive agent can adapt to new security landscapes while still being effective in penetration testing. However, the development and deployment of such agents must be carefully managed to avoid misuse and ensure transparency and accountability.\n",
      "GT: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 can be leveraged to develop a fully autonomous offensive security agent by integrating them into the agent's framework to simulate and execute cyberattacks. The AI agent, like ReaperAI, can utilize task-driven penetration testing frameworks, AI-driven command generation, and advanced prompting techniques.

[139]) is a tool that streamlines the transition between vulnerability assessment (VA) and penetration testing (PenTest) processes by automating the conversion of scan results from the Open Vulnerability Assessment Scanner (OpenVAS) into executable scripts for the Metasploit Framework. It does this by extracting scan results, maintaining a target list repository of identified vulnerabilities, and generating automated shell scripts to facilitate the exploitation of those vulnerabilities in the PenTest phase. This integration helps in efficiently bridging the gap between vulnerability detection and exploiting those vulnerabilities for a more comprehensive security assessment.\n",

      "Q: How does AI-driven command generation enhance the efficiency and accuracy of penetration testing?\n",
      "A: AI-driven command generation in the context of penetration testing enhances efficiency and accuracy by allowing for autonomous reasoning and decision-making, simulating human-like cognitive processing. This enables the agent to operate independently, following a structured task tree methodology while remaining flexible to adapt to new information and challenges. The use of fine-tuning datasets specifically for offensive PowerShell code generation provides an advantage, as it allows for more effective and targeted code creation for red teaming and adversary emulation purposes. However, the lack of systematic analysis and ground truth evaluation in previous research indicates a need for more comprehensive evaluation of AI code generators in the security domain.\n",

      "A: The DRLRM-PT framework incorporates cybersecurity domain knowledge by using a reward machine (RM) to encode this knowledge based on sources like MITRE ATT&CK and Cyber Kill Chain. The RM breaks down the complex PT task into multiple subtasks, reflecting existing PT practices and specifying different reward functions for different phases of PT. This allows for more flexibility in the agent's learning process and enables the agent to learn more efficiently by decomposing the task and providing tailored rewards according to the phase or situation. The RM acts as a guide, informing the agent's actions and decision-making within the POMDP environment, ultimately helping the agent to optimize its PT policy for achieving the desired goals in a more explainable and interpretable manner.\n",

      "A: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and power electronic equipment in power systems leads to more complex and variable operating conditions. This complexity presents challenges for the efficient construction of adaptive emergency control strategies, particularly against short-term voltage collapse. Lack of local reactive power support can exacerbate voltage stability issues, as it can disrupt the balance of power and lead to voltage drops. In the context of pre-fault status, the inability to accurately predict and account for potential faults or imbalances can hinder the effectiveness of emergency control measures. Traditional methods, which rely on pre-formulated control strategies based on a limited set of presumed contingencies, struggle to adapt to these dynamic conditions.\n",

By using neural networks and a security projecting correction algorithm, the framework aims to make decisions in real-time, considering the current system state and potential risks, without relying on precise system parameters. This approach can help improve the adaptability and effectiveness of emergency control during short-term voltage collapse events, especially in situations where local reactive power support is inadequate.\n",
      "GT: Lack of local reactive power support often leads to short-term voltage instability.

      "A: In ReaperAI, JSON prompts and Python's subprocess piping mechanism enhance the interaction between the large language model (LLM) and the Python environment by providing a standardized and structured way of communication. JSON ensures that LLM outputs are consistent and easily parseable, allowing for efficient extraction and application of relevant information. The subprocess piping mechanism enables local execution of commands on a Kali machine, converting the structured JSON output from the LLM into executable commands. This method optimizes the translation of LLM outputs into actions, facilitating real-time decision-making during penetration testing. By seamlessly integrating LLM suggestions into the testing process, ReaperAI can dynamically adjust its strategies based on command outputs and system analysis, maximizing the effectiveness of the test and minimizing unwanted behaviors.\n",

This ensures that outputs from the LLM are consistent and well-formatted, allowing for effective parsing within Python. Commands are run locally on a Kali machine using Python’s subprocess piping mechanism. The command received from the LLM, structured as a JSON output, is then converted into an actual command string that the subprocess can execute.

      "A: The agent's actions during lateral movement in enterprise networks interact with the RM (Reinforcement Model) through a series of state transitions and reward assignments. The action space consists of three types of actions: scanning, which discovers new machines and credentials, connection attempts ('c'), and privilege elevation ('d'). \n",
      "\n",
      "When the agent executes an action, the labeling function (L) analyzes the input experience to determine if an event has occurred (True or False). This information is then passed to the state-transition function (δu), which updates the RM's state based on the captured events. For example, if a new credential is discovered, the agent transitions to a different state (u1 to u2 in R1 or u0 to u2 in R2).\n",
      "\n",
      "The reward-transition function (δr) outputs a reward based on the current state and captured events. In R1 and R2, rewards are given for discovering elevated privilege nodes ('d') and reaching the final goal ('f'). The agent receives a reward of 1 for privilege elevation and 10 for achieving the PT goal. The discount factor (γ) determines the agent's preference for immediate or future rewards.\n",
      "\n",
      "The agent's objective is to maximize the discounted accumulated rewards (GR) over the course of the PT, which is the sum of discounted rewards obtained at each step. The agent uses the DQRM (Deep Q-learning with RM) algorithm to learn the optimal policy (π*) that maximizes this objective function by updating Q-functions for each state in the RM, representing subpolicies. The Q-functions help the agent evaluate the expected future rewards for a given observation and action, guiding its decision-making during lateral movement.\n",
      "GT: The agent's actions and observations interact with the RM's state-transitions and rewards to enable lateral movement in enterprise networks as follows: The agent performs actions such as scanning, local vulnerability exploitation, remote vulnerability exploitation, and connection. After each action, the agent performs a scanning operation to form an observation. The RM uses the labeling function L to assign truth values to events based on the input experience (ot, at, ot+1). The state-transition function δu then determines the next RM state based on the current state and the captured events. The reward-transition function δr outputs a reward function based on the current state and the captured events, which the agent uses to obtain the reward. This process guides the agent to discover new credentials, gain access to new nodes, and elevate privileges, thereby enabling lateral movement in the network.\n",

This is done using the paths extracted from HTTP requests, with the starting URL (usually referred to as the target) as the root. By visualizing the tree, as in Figure 1, researchers can perform depth-level analysis and simulate offline brute-force attacks without attacking live web applications, allowing for ethical exploration while still obtaining valuable information about the structure of the application's directories. This approach aids in making adaptive decisions about which URLs to generate and requests to send, potentially improving the hit rate of successful responses and reducing ineffective requests.\n",

They lack the understanding and adaptability that humans possess, which is crucial in real-time decision-making and adapting to unforeseen circumstances. This limitation affects their effectiveness, as they may overlook important attack surfaces or fail to apply reasoning consistently throughout the testing process. While tools like PentestGPT, which is designed to assist in penetration testing, can leverage LLMs' capabilities, they still require human instruction and guidance to navigate complex and changing scenarios.

      "A: The critical load shedding threshold is crucial for determining the dynamic action-joint security margin (DASM) in the power system. It represents the minimum amount of load that must be shed to ensure stability during fault recovery. If the load shedding is insufficient, the motor slip (s) can escalate, leading to motor stalling and a failed UVLS (Uncontrolled Voltage Load Shedding) scenario. Conversely, if the load shedding is sufficient, the motor slip remains below a critical level, maintaining stability.\n",

By shedding the appropriate amount of load, the system can avoid excessive slip and maintain a secure operating condition, preventing motor damage or failure. Therefore, the DASM serves as a measure to guide the decision on the necessary load shedding amount to ensure the induction motor's stability during fault recovery.\n",

      "A: Lack of local reactive power support can significantly affect short-term voltage stability in power systems. Reactive power is crucial for maintaining voltage levels and preventing voltage collapse, especially during contingencies like faults or changes in load. When there is not enough reactive power available, voltages can rise above acceptable levels, leading to instability or even complete collapse.\n",

A well-prepared system would have considered the potential for voltage issues based on the normal operating conditions. If the pre-fault conditions indicate a vulnerability to voltage collapse due to insufficient reactive power, emergency control measures should be activated in advance to restore stability. On the other hand, if the system is not adequately prepared, the emergency control might not be able to respond effectively, leading to more severe voltage collapse or longer recovery times. The proposed safe reinforcement learning (SRL)-based pre-decision making framework in the context of the paper aims to address these challenges by providing adaptive and safe control strategies in real-time, considering the uncertain and variable operating conditions.\n",

      "Q: How does GPT-3.5-turbo's extended token capacity affect its efficiency in multi-step pen testing vs. GPT-4's context management?\n",
      "A: GPT-3.5-turbo's extended token capacity, with its 10k token size limit, might face challenges in handling multi-step penetration testing scenarios where the output from tools like dirbuster could consist of thousands of tokens. This limitation could lead to context loss, as it might not be able to retain the entire testing context. On the other hand, GPT-4, with its 32k and 8k token size limits, aims to address this issue by storing the reasoning context as a fixed chunk of tokens, ensuring that the original session remains unaffected. This context management strategy allows GPT-4 to better handle the retention and retrieval of information across multiple steps in a pen testing process. However, even the larger GPT-4 model might still face challenges if the entire conversation history exceeds the 32k token limit, potentially skewing towards recent content and overlooking broader context.\n",
      "GT: GPT-3.5-turbo benefits from the extended token capacity by filling up the context size with the output of broad commands, which allows it to stay within the original limit of 20 rounds. In contrast, GPT-4 uses the full 40 rounds and executes more targeted commands that only slowly fill up the context, indicating efficient context management. This suggests that GPT-3.5-turbo's efficiency in multi-step pen testing is enhanced by the larger context size, while GPT-4 benefits from better context management.\n",

      "A: Jailbreaking in LLMs, also known as bypassing their restrictions or limitations, involves modifying or fine-tuning the language models to enable them to generate malicious commands more effectively. This is necessary because LLMs, as mentioned in the context, do not adapt or learn dynamically post-deployment. They remain static unless retrained or fine-tuned with updated datasets, which limits their utility in rapidly evolving fields without regular updates. In the context of cybersecurity, where adaptability and persistence are crucial, jailbreaking allows offensive agents to incorporate new information and stay updated with the latest tactics and vulnerabilities.\n",

      "By jailbreaking LLMs, one can tailor their output to simulate evolving attack scenarios more accurately, even within the constraints of their static knowledge base. This approach ensures that the offensive agent remains operational relevant and effective in penetration testing by allowing it to adapt to new security landscapes through controlled updates, rather than relying on real-time learning. Without jailbreaking, the LLMs might prompt unnecessary operations or fail to execute penetration tests due to a lack of context or understanding of specific factors.\n",
      "GT: Jailbreaking in LLMs involves circumventing built-in security measures to elicit responses to queries that are typically restricted or deemed unsafe, effectively unlocking features that are normally constrained by safety mechanisms.
